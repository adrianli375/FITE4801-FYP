# FITE4801-FYP

This is the GitHub repository for Project [FYP23003](https://wp2023.cs.hku.hk/fyp23003/). This project is under the course [FITE4801 Project](https://cs.hku.hk/index.php/programmes/course-offered?infile=2023/fite4801.html), at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) for the academic year 2023-2024. 

NOTE: These codes can only be run with the [QuantConnect back-testing engine](https://www.quantconnect.com/) which requires a paid subscription. These codes cannot be run with a standard terminal. 

Our final developed algorithm is based on the Moving Average Strategy (inside the [MA](./code/MA) directory), from Version 1 up to Version 7. Some intermediate versions are also present.
